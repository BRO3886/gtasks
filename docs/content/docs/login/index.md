summary: Login to Google Tasks CLI with your Google Account
---

- To login, all you need to do is type:

```
gtasks login
```

- This will open your browser for Google authentication and start a local callback server.
- If the browser does not open automatically, the CLI prints a URL you can visit manually.
- After you grant access, the browser will show a success page. You can close it and return to the terminal.
- Your login is complete and you'll be able to see and manage your tasks.
